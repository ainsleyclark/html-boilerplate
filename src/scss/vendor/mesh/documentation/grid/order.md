# Order
Order will allow you to change the visual order of columns (or flex items). You may want to order something first on desktop but last when it shrinks down to mobile. Here are our classes to help you with that:

| Notation                |                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | 
| Default                 | order-{value} for default                              |   
| Responsive              | order-{breakpoint}-{value} for mob, tab, desk & hd     |
